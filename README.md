> ⚠️ This project is **very** early stages - expect crashes, bugs, and confusing output!

## Quick Start

I recommend you install using `pipx`, which will allow you to use `dunk` from anywhere.

```
pipx install dunk
```

## Basic Usage

Pipe the output of `git diff` into `dunk`:

```
git diff | dunk
```

or add it to git as an alias:
```
git config --global alias.dunk '!git diff | dunk'
```

### Paging

You can pipe output from `dunk` into a pager such as `less`:

```
git diff | dunk | less -R
```
